# Snipper

This package is a TYPO3 extension to modify external links on your website.

As explained [in this article on developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener)
opening an external link with `target="_blank"` can negatively impact your page's performance, as this newly opened page 
might run on the same process as your page. It also poses a security risk because the other page can potentially redirect 
your page to a malicious URL or change your page's content using JavaScript.

This extension adds a Hook for all links generated by TYPO3 using a `typolink` and adds `rel="noopener"` to all
links that open in a new window (`target="_blank"`) and do not have a `rel` attribute, yet. This affects all links 
generated by TypoScript (including RTE content added by your editors) or using the Fluid ViewHelper `<f:link.typolink>`.

## How to install this extension?

You can set this up via composer (`composer require b13/snipper`).

## License

The extension is licensed under GPL v2+, same as the TYPO3 Core.
